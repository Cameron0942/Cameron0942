<h1>Hi there! 👋</h1>

<h2>ℹ About me</h2>

<p>🎓 My name is Cameron Burns. I am a self-taught web developer who is aiming to break into the tech industry by developing systems for a backend environment. I have some university experience in Computer Science, but have not yet graduated. I have learned a bulk of what I know through self teaching.</p>
<p>👀 Currently I’m interested in learning as much as I can about backend web development, and how to write robust and clean code.</p>
<p>🌱 I’m currently learning (to name a few) Node.JS, React.JS, and SQL databases to round out my knowledge of web development.</p>
<p>🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, and am really enthusiastic about learning new technologies. I have been programming on and off for about 6 years in various languages, and have finally set off to learn everything I can about the JavaScript language.</p>
<p>📫 You can reach me here if you want to collab with me! Or feel free to message me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cameron--burns/">my LinkedIn</a> for business inquiries.</p>
