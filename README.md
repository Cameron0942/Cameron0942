<h2>‚Ñπ About me</h2>

<p>üéì My name is Cameron Burns. I am a self-taught web developer aiming to break into the tech industry by developing systems for backend environments. I have some university experience in Computer Science, but have not yet graduated. I have learned a bulk of what I know through self teaching.</p>
<p>üëÄ Currently I‚Äôm interested in learning as much as I can about backend web development, and how to write robust and clean code.</p>
<p>üå± I‚Äôm currently learning (to name a few) Node.JS, React.JS, and MySQL to round out my knowledge of web development.</p>
<p>ü§ù I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on open source projects, and am really enthusiastic about learning new technologies. I have been programming on and off for about 6 years in various languages, and have finally set off to learn everything I can about the JavaScript language.</p>
